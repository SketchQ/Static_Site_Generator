# Static Site Generator
Overview
The Static Site Generator (SSG) is a Python-based tool designed to transform raw content files, such as Markdown and images, into a static website consisting of HTML and CSS files. This approach is particularly popular for blogs and content-heavy websites due to its speed, security, and ease of hosting.

## Features
Converts Markdown (.md) files into HTML pages using specified templates.
Copies images and other static assets to the destination directory.
Supports recursive directory traversal to handle nested content structures.
Provides customizable templates for consistent page layout and styling.
## Why Use a Static Site Generator?
Static sites offer several advantages over dynamic websites:

Speed: With no server-side processing, static sites load faster, enhancing user experience and SEO.
Security: Reduced attack surface compared to dynamic sites with databases and server-side logic.
Simplicity: Easier deployment and maintenance, especially with version control systems like Git.
